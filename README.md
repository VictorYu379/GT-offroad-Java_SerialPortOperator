SerialTest.java uses rxtx Library
SerialPortTest.java uses jssc Library

SerialTest.java works better under short delay condition, normally works fine when Arduino delays 100 milliseconds or lower.
SerialPortTest.java is simpler to use, because jssc library is easier in coding, but doesn't work as fine as rxtx.
